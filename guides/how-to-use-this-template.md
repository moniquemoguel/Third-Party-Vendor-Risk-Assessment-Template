##  Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. **Start with the Questionnaire**
- Navigate to `templates/vendor-risk-questionnaire.md`
- Copy the full list of questions
- Send to the vendor or internal contact responsible for vendor oversight


---

### 2. **Collect and Review Responses**
- Ask the vendor to return the questionnaire with completed responses.
- Look for:
  - Gaps in controls
  - Lack of documentation
  - Incomplete certifications
  - Red flags in incident response or data handling

---

### 3. **Use the Sample for Comparison**
- Open `sample-completed-assessment.md` to see what a complete, strong submission looks like
- Use it to benchmark real vendor responses

---

### 4. **Score and Summarize Risks**
- Internally assess each section using your organization’s risk categories (Low / Medium / High)
- Create a short summary table (see the sample file for formatting)

---

### 5. **Map to Frameworks (Optional)**
- If your organization follows a compliance framework (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001, SOC 2), use the `docs/framework-mapping.md` file to show how each question aligns to control objectives.

##  Best Practices

- Keep vendor submissions in a secure location.
- Use a system to track updates to their answers over time.
- Schedule re-assessments annually or when significant changes occur (e.g., new service, merger, breach).
